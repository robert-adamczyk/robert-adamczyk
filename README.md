<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Robert Adamczyk</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate python developer from Poland</h3>
<h5 align="center">About me </h5>

Responsible, motivated novice programmer. I found my path and I know that programming is something where I can fulfill myself. My strength is the analysis and decomposition of a given task into prime factors, which is useful when analyzing new lines of code. Studies have taught me to work with data and draw conclusions based on it, which I personally like to do very much. Solving problems gives me satisfaction, and from the problems encountered and my own mistakes made I draw conclusions and treat it as the best lesson for self-improvement.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Django, Pandas, NumPy**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Turbine-power-Web](https://github.com/robert-adamczyk/Turbine-power-Web)

>Project based on my master's thesis. The user, by means of turibna models introduced by special users (is_company) and data about the wind strength provided by external api, the user will be able to check the energy production by a given turbine model in the period selected by him, along with other results. Of course, the project will include other features as well.


- ðŸ“„ My projects:
  - https://github.com/zdpytpol45-project3/Weather_portal
      Web application in Django, which, by connecting to the OpenWeather API,
      allows you to check the current weather conditions in selected cities.
      A registered user can view more than one city and save it to favorites.
      The system notifies the user of unsafe conditions. The application was built
      with two contributors.
  - https://github.com/robert-adamczyk/Wind-turbine-power
      A project in Jupyter Notebook, which is able to show us the power generated by
      this wind turbine in a selected period of time based on the wind speed data
      from the meteo API and the characteristics of the wind turbine.
  - https://github.com/robert-adamczyk/Collection
      Web application in Django that allows you to share the videos you like to watch
      with others. The user can update and delete only his own data, and not logged
      in has access only to the preview. A view in the REST API is also available.
  - https://github.com/robert-adamczyk/Calculator
      A simple calculator that allows you to use basic mathematical operations and
      read files. The emphasis was on testing in pytest, where coverage was achieved
      in the pytest-cov report of 100%. Fixture and Mock were also used in the tests.

As a final project on the software academy developer programming course, together with my group, we were tasked with creating a simple weather application using the django framework. [Link to GitHub for more details and code](https://github.com/zdpytpol45-project3/Weather_portal)
