<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Robert Adamczyk</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate python developer from Poland</h3>
<h5 align="center">About me </h5>

Responsible, motivated novice programmer. I found my path and I know that programming is something where I can fulfill myself. My strength is the analysis and decomposition of a given task into prime factors, which is useful when analyzing new lines of code. Studies have taught me to work with data and draw conclusions based on it, which I personally like to do very much. Solving problems gives me satisfaction, and from the problems encountered and my own mistakes made I draw conclusions and treat it as the best lesson for self-improvement.

>Project based on my master's thesis. The user, by means of turibna models introduced by special users (is_company) and data about the wind strength provided by external api, the user will be able to check the energy production by a given turbine model in the period selected by him, along with other results. Of course, the project will include other features as well.
